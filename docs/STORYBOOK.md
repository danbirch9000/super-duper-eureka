# Storybook

Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular.

All files ending in `*.stories.js` will be added to the Storybook pages.

To preview the storybook run:
```
npm run storybook:serve
```
There is a future need to add the built version to Gitlab page.
